## ✨ What's Inside?

Welcome to this magical trash can, filled with secrets, chaos, and outside-the-box highlights.  
Dive in to find out that nothing makes sense — only **RX** does.  

At least, we are here in this moment, on this long-lasting journey, in this eternal life.  
Treat it kindly, feed it cookies, and occasionally whisper to it at night.  

**GGWP**, brothers.

2. Read the code carefully. It’s just random words.  
3. Run it if you desire. (You're not getting paid either.)

## 🧙‍♂️ Final Words

In case of confusion:  
**Turn it off and go touch grass.**  
In case of happiness:  
**Reconsider your mental state.**  
In case of fire:  
**Well...** (insert awkward smiley emoji)

**GGRX!** 🚀
